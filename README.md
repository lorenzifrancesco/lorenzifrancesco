Welcome to the GitHub page where I develop my software projects, related to ultracold atom physics, photonics, applied electrodynamics and more.
(Take a look at my [scientific blog](https://lorenzifrancesco.github.io/)!)

Also you can find some tinkering with programming languages and styles that I am interested in. 

Feel free to contact me at francesco [dot] lorenzi [dot] 2 [at] phd.unipd.it
